## Course Content

### Season-1 | Interview Question Mastery

#### Ep-00 | Introduction

**Javascript Interview Questions** is a web series that will cover popular frontend interview questions asked by top software engineering companies.

#### Ep-01 | call, apply and bind method

Explore the core functionalities of `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods in JavaScript. Learn how these methods enable function invocation and manipulation of the 'this' keyword, aiding in dynamic context binding.

#### Ep-02 | Polyfill for Bind Method

Delve into the process of creating a Polyfill for the Bind method in JavaScript. Understand how to replicate the functionality of Bind for older browser support, ensuring consistent behaviour across various environments.

#### Ep-03 | Currying in Js

Unravel the concept of Currying, a technique to transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of nested functions, simplifying function composition and parameter handling.

#### Ep-04 | Debouncing (Asked by FlipKart)

Grasp the significance of Debouncing, a technique to optimize event handling by controlling the frequency of function executions, preventing rapid-fire calls and enhancing performance.

#### Ep-05 | Async and Defer attributes (Asked by Ola)

Differentiate between the Async and Defer attributes in script loading, understanding their impact on parsing, execution, and page rendering for optimized resource loading strategies.

#### Ep-06 | Event Bubbling (Asked by Oyo)

Discover Event Bubbling, a propagation mechanism where events travel through nested elements, allowing efficient event handling through the DOM hierarchy.

#### Ep-07 | Event Delegation

Explore Event Delegation as a technique to manage event handling by assigning a single handler to multiple elements, optimizing memory usage and performance.

#### Ep-08 | Sum(1)(2)(3)(4)..(n) (Asked by Amazon)

Dive into the world of curried functions to create a chaining mechanism for summing numbers, enabling a concise and flexible approach to handling arithmetic operations.

#### Ep-09 | Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance

Explore Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance, foundational concepts in JavaScript, and understand how objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.

#### Ep-10 | Thinking Recursively

Grasp the essence of Recursion, an indispensable technique in JavaScript programming, mastering its application in solving complex problems through iterative function calls.

#### Ep-11 | CORS, Preflight Requests, and the OPTIONS Method

Understand Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), Preflight Requests, and the OPTIONS Method, essential concepts enabling secure cross-origin communication in web applications.

#### Ep-12 | Debouncing vs Throttling (Asked by walmart)

Distinguish between Debouncing and Throttling techniques, each serving distinct purposes in managing function calls, enhancing performance, and optimizing user experience.

#### Ep-13 | Throttling in Javascript (Asked by walmart)

Delve into Throttling as a mechanism to limit the rate of function execution, ensuring controlled invocation and efficient resource utilization in various scenarios.
